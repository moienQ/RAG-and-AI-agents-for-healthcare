RAG and AI Agent for Healthcare Using LangChain


Overview
This project showcases the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI agents in the healthcare domain, leveraging the power of LangChain. It focuses on building advanced AI systems capable of processing complex medical queries, retrieving relevant data, and providing accurate, context-aware insights. The aim is to revolutionize healthcare delivery by integrating AI technologies to improve decision-making and patient care.




Features
Natural Language Understanding: Ability to understand and respond to medical queries in human-like language.
RAG Integration: Combines retrieval-based systems with generative AI to ensure accuracy and relevance.
Domain-Specific Knowledge: Incorporates healthcare datasets and knowledge bases for tailored responses.
Scalability and Adaptability: Designed to scale across various healthcare applications.



Technologies Used
LangChain: Framework for building language models with integrated tools.
OpenAI/LLMs: For natural language understanding and generation.
Python: Programming language used for development.
Healthcare Datasets: Domain-specific data for training and validation.
